## This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Made the Description more a precise, as suggested. Changed it from "Functions that help facilitate data exploration." to "Functions that make understanding the structure of objects more convenient. Display extensive details about objects with ease and quickly obtain essential information about data frames in a visually appealing manner."

## Test environments
* local OS X install (Sierra), R 3.4.2
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. There was 1 NOTE on win-builder:

"checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: 'Florian Simon Schaffner <schaffner.florian@gmail.com>'"

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies.
